# Automated tests 
For automatic testing I used Javascript and Cypress.
Below are the descriptions of each test performed by me.
---------------------------------------
- Test 1 checks the login with the wrong user or password, and then checks if an error message appears.
+ Test 2 checks the login with the standard user, and then checks if you are logged in.
* Test 3 is a logout test, in which you must first be logged in to be able to log out, which is done by pressing the Logout menu on the top left.
- Test 4 checks if the side menu can be opened and closed.
+ Test 5 adds a product to the cart (adding the product to the cart and checking if it has been added).
* Test 6 checks if a product can be deleted from the cart, and then checks if the product is gone or if the cart is empty.
- Test 7 checks if a product can be ordered by adding it to the cart and following all the checkout steps until the order is placed.
+ Test 8 checks if you can access the page with the details of a product, i.e. the page that appears when you click on a product.
* Test 9 checks if the "Back to product" button on a product page takes you to the main page.
