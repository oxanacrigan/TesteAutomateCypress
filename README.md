# Automated tests 
For automatic testing I used Javascript and Cypress.
Below are the descriptions of each test performed by me.
---------------------------------------
- Test number 1 checks the login with the wrong user or password, and then checks if an error message appears.
+ The 2nd test checks the login with the standard user, and then checks if you are logged in.
